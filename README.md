So basically, this is a chatbot like [Woebot](https://woebothealth.com/) to help with mental health issues, but in Discord. It's a weird combination, but it allows more people to get help. I think this is genuinely one of my most helpful projects.

## Commands
There's not many commands this bot has since it only specializes in one thing, but here are the commands and their full description.

```
help - Simply get the current commands and the prefix, which is just a mention of MentalBot
ask - Directly get asked 5 questions regarding mental status and recieve a score out of 10 (101% private!)
subscribe - Receive a daily notification to run the ask command
scrap - Remove all data you created
scrap.sub - Removes your subscription status only.
```

## What's next?
Well, I'm planning on making some kind of alert system which simply DMs the user to run the ask command every day or so. Of course this will be a command.

## What are you gonna do if people self-host your bot and steal people's data?
I don't know, just **please** don't do that.

<sub>Yes I know it is built on discord.js@12.0.0 i really don't care</sub>
